# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I've learned about the flag package in Golang, and how to incorporate it into my tcp scanner tool rather than rely on arguments.

**Thoughts**: I've only been learning Golang for a few short weeks, but I am very please with how it is coming along!

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Golang flag package](https://github.com/goodlandsecurity/go_scan/commit/6b5246a508cf8c6653ca1b1f0d93bbfecd499bd3)

### Day 2: December 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Maps! Golang's equivalent to Python's dictionaries. 

**Thoughts**: It was really straight forward, however I struggled with understanding how to declare a global map in one package that could be accessed from main package. It turns out you need to capitalize your global variables, or you're going to have a bad time!  

**Link(s) to work**:
2. [Calling a global map to get a key's value from main (line 75)](https://github.com/goodlandsecurity/go_scan/commit/4f659d3da13952fbcb084987b863621a45c2dcff)

### Day 3: December 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about DNS clients, processing answers from a MSG struct and retrieving/querying A and CNAME records. 

**Thoughts**: I am really enjoying Golang!

**Link(s) to work**:
3. [subfinder - enumerating subdomains!](https://github.com/goodlandsecurity/subfinder)
