# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I've learned about the flag package in Golang, and how to incorporate it into my tcp scanner tool rather than rely on arguments.

**Thoughts** I've only been learning Golang for a few short weeks, but I am very please with how it is coming along!
